# Optix-Learning
Now I am trying to make a guide for Optix as I too learn myself, kind of like a blog? I'll try to make it as understandable as possible

## Where to start learning
1. [This](https_developer.nvidia.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.nvidia.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-get-started-with-optix-7%2F) is one of the best starting point
> I will keep adding to the list so dont worry about that
### Miscellaneous
* [OPTIX programming guide](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/guide/index.html#preface#preface)
* [OPTIX API documentation](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/api/group__optix__utilities.html#ga23324468bd477541fca0ef385a806fd6)
> Yes they arent as fancy as you thought it would be, but bare with me

## Updates
1. August 31 - Covered the basics of optix api, and went through the optix triangle sample
> Things have started making sense atleast for now for some time, lets hope it keeps up like that

## Tasks
- [ ] Add some code that can help others learn too
- [ ] Read more about shader binding table
- [ ] Start reading _Ray Tracing Gems 1_ chapter 3
- [ ] Create one normal ray tracer (probably for starters optix triangle all by yourself)
- [ ] Create one normal ray tracer (something a bit more complex)
- [ ] Read all the sample codes and check out what all have been left

## Doubts
- [ ] Check out the doubts folder in the code file
